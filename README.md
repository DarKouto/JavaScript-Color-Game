# JavaScript Color Game
A RGB Color Guessing Game made with JavaScript

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on JavaScript Programming.

The goal here was to create a simple game, in which the user is provided with a randomly generated RGB code, and then has to guess the corresponding color from 6 randomly generated colors (or 3 in the easy mode).

This also features some CSS styling with a few simple animations.
